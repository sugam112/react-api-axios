          Due to time restrictions, the dev has chose to ignore the UI Design
          part on purpose. Such as pagination/onScrollAnimation/Cards/preLoader
          etc.

          The dev has only focused on completing the task as mentioned in the
          email, but there are multiple updates that he can add on if provided
          the necessary time to be creative.

        <li>
          Products are sorted in descending order of their popularity as
          mentioned.
